**Summary:** The past year has been a difficult one. A pandemic has taken millions of lives and disrupted “normal” routines across the globe. In the United States, more than 450,000 lives have been lost, and some have pointed to rampant misinformation about Covid-19 as a potential factor in our country’s relatively poor response to the virus. Sociologists of disaster have long known that we are particularly vulnerable to the spread of misinformation during times of crisis — due to uncertainty in the information environment and anxiety about what the impacts will be and how we should respond. Covid-19 represents a perfect storm for misinformation, with persistent uncertainty surrounding the disease and the public increasingly relying on online information systems where misinformation is already pervasive. In this talk, I will demonstrate some of the ways that misinformation — and disinformation — about Covid-19 have spread through online spaces over the past year, demonstrating some of the structure and dynamics of this phenomenon. After laying out the problems, I aim to end on a more hopeful note, with a call to action for researchers and industry professionals to help “chip away” at this critical societal issue.

**Kate Starbird** is an Associate Professor at the Department of Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) at the University of Washington (UW). Kate’s research sits in the emerging field of crisis informatics—the study of how social media and other communication technologies are used during crisis events. Currently, her work focuses on the production and spread of online rumors, misinformation, and disinformation in the crisis context. Starbird is a co-founder of the UW Center for an Informed Public.
