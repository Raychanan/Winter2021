**Registration**: The presentation will be held virtually on Zoom. For security purposes, please register through this [**link**](https://uchicago.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYtduirqzsoGdxeNsAUg_4wKwrL3K7PmEdM) to request access. Only accounts affiliated with the University of Chicago will be granted access.


**Summary:** From July to January of 2020, Stanford Internet Observatory researchers worked with a coalition of researchers, government entities, tech companies, and civil society organizations in an multi-stakeholder partnership called the Election Integrity Partnership (EIP). Its mission was to rapidly detect high-velocity and potentially impactful false and misleading narratives related to voting. This talk will discuss findings from the partnership: how incidents became narratives, the rise of bottom-up misinformation, the dynamics of repeat spreaders, and the way in which platform policies shape message propagation. It will also discuss the mechanisms of the EIP itself and the way in which such a model might be applied more broadly, including towards health misinformation.

**Renee DiResta** is the Research Manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory. She investigates the spread of malign narratives across social networks, and assists policymakers in understanding and responding to the problem. She has advised Congress, the State Department, and other academic, civic, and business organizations, and has studied disinformation and computational propaganda in the context of pseudoscience conspiracies, terrorism, and state-sponsored information warfare.
