**Summary:** In light of the increasingly aggressive policies and rhetoric of the Chinese government, many came to believe that China poses a threat to democracy and the international order. However, less attention has been paid to Chinese popular attitudes toward democracy. How does the Chinese public think of democracy in the changing domestic and international environment? This paper uses a novel data set of Chinese social media posts published between 2009 and 2017 and investigates the changes in popular attitudes toward democracy in the 2010s. Results show that Chinese online discussion was once dominated by liberal voices, yet doubt and disillusionment with democracy have become pronounced since 2013. While tightened state control is a factor shaping popular attitudes, a declining democratic legitimacy has also played into this trend. Particularly, Chinese peopleâ€™s rosy expectations of model democracy were challenged by increasing exposure to perceived subpar performance and racial discrimination of democratic regimes. This, in turn, strengthens popular support for the Chinese government, constituting what I call a passive political legitimacy of the Chinese regime.

**Yinxian Zhang** is an assistant professor of sociology at CUNY Queens College. Her research focuses on political opinion, the (online) public sphere, and state-society relations in authoritarian contexts. Her work combines computational and qualitative methods to analyze political discourses and communication patterns from large-scale textual data. Her ongoing book project delves into the interplays between state control, popular opinion, and regime legitimacy, and how they jointly shape the nature of the public sphere. Yinxian received her M.A. and Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago. Prior to joining Queens College, she was a China Public Policy Postdoctoral Fellow at the Ash Center at Harvard.
